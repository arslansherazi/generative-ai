    "n LangGraph, **HITL** means that during the execution of the agent graph, **a human can pause, review, and approve (or modify)** intermediate outputs before the system proceeds to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is critical when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system makes important decisions (e.g., summarizing sensitive data, taking financial or operational actions),\n",
    "\n",
    "- or when accuracy and trustworthiness matter (e.g., healthcare, policy interpretation, legal reasoning).\n",

    "**How it works in LangGraph**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph provides mechanisms to **pause a graph** run, notify a human, and then **resume execution** with human feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The graph runs through its nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When it reaches a node that requires human validation, it **pauses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **human operator** (via UI, API, or CLI) can inspect the agent’s reasoning, input, or proposed action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The human can **approve, modify, or reject** the output.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Use Case: Classifying Customer Reviews with Human Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) use case demonstrates how an AI model can automatically classify customer reviews (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) and then involve a human to verify or correct the AI’s output whenever the model’s confidence is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An e-commerce company receives thousands of product reviews daily.\n",
    "To analyze customer sentiment automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The AI model (e.g., OpenAI or another LLM) predicts whether each review is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model’s confidence is below a defined threshold (e.g., < 0.7), the review is sent to a human reviewer for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The human feedback is stored and later used to fine-tune or retrain the model to improve accuracy."
