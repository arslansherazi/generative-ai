      "ðŸ”§ Sensor Analysis:\n",
      " Based on the provided vehicle sensor readings, here are the analyses and potential issues identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Engine Temperature: 105Â°C**\n",
      "   - **Analysis**: This temperature is higher than the typical operating range for most engines, which is usually between 90Â°C and 100Â°C. An engine temperature of 105Â°C could indicate overheating.\n",
      "   - **Potential Issues**: Possible causes for overheating include low coolant levels, a malfunctioning thermostat, a failing water pump, or a blocked radiator. Immediate attention is recommended to prevent engine damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Battery Voltage: 11.2V**\n",
      "   - **Analysis**: A healthy car battery typically reads between 12.4V and 12.7V when the engine is off and around 13.7V to 14.7V when the engine is running (due to the alternator charging the battery). A reading of 11.2V suggests that the battery is undercharged or failing.\n",
      "   - **Potential Issues**: This could indicate a weak battery, a failing alternator, or an electrical drain on the battery. It may require testing or replacement to ensure reliable vehicle operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tire Pressure: Low**\n",
      "   - **Analysis**: Low tire pressure can lead to reduced fuel efficiency, poor handling, and increased tire wear. The specific pressure value is not provided, but it is essential to check the recommended tire pressure for the vehicle.\n",
      "   - **Potential Issues**: Causes of low tire pressure can include punctures, leaks, or simply not being inflated to the correct level. It is advisable to inflate the tires to the recommended pressure and check for any leaks or damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Oil Pressure: 18 PSI**\n",
      "   - **Analysis**: Normal oil pressure for most vehicles typically ranges from 25 to 65 PSI when the engine is running. A reading of 18 PSI is low and could indicate insufficient oil circulation.\n",
      "   - **Potential Issues**: Low oil pressure can be caused by low oil levels, a failing oil pump, or a clogged oil filter. This condition can lead to serious engine damage if not addressed promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Issues:\n",
      "- **Overheating Engine**: Immediate investigation needed to prevent damage.\n",
      "- **Undercharged Battery**: Check battery health and charging system.\n",
      "- **Low Tire Pressure**: Inflate tires and check for leaks.\n",
      "- **Low Oil Pressure**: Check oil levels and system for potential failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Address the overheating issue as a priority.\n",
      "- Test the battery and charging system.\n",
      "- Inflate tires to the correct pressure and inspect for damage.\n",
      "- Check oil levels and consider an oil change or inspection of the oil system. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is advisable to consult a qualified mechanic to diagnose and resolve these issues effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "ðŸ’¬ Feedback Summary:\n",
      " Based on the customer feedback provided, the key issues can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Engine Overheating**: The customer is experiencing problems with the engine overheating, which could indicate potential issues with the cooling system, thermostat, or other engine components.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Poor Fuel Efficiency**: The customer reports that the vehicle is not performing well in terms of fuel consumption, suggesting possible issues with the engine, fuel system, or driving habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Strange Noises When Braking**: The customer has noted unusual sounds when applying the brakes, which could point to problems with the brake pads, rotors, or other braking system components.\n",
      "\n",
      "These issues indicate potential mechanical problems that may require inspection and repair to ensure the vehicle operates safely and efficiently. \n",
      "\n",
      "ðŸ“š Recommended Solution:\n",
      " Based on the provided sensor data and customer feedback, here are some relevant maintenance procedures and solutions for the issues identified:\n",

      "\n",
      "### 2. **Low Oil Pressure (18 PSI)**\n",
      "   - **Diagnosis**: Low oil pressure can lead to engine damage and is often caused by low oil levels, a failing oil pump, or a clogged oil filter.\n",
      "   - **Possible Causes**:\n",
      "     - Low oil level\n",
      "     - Worn engine bearings\n",
      "     - Faulty oil pump\n",
      "     - Clogged oil filter\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Maintenance Procedures**:\n",
      "     - **Check Oil Level**: Verify the oil level and top up if necessary.\n",
      "     - **Inspect Oil Pump**: Test the oil pump for proper operation. Replace if it is not generating adequate pressure.\n",
      "     - **Change Oil and Oil Filter**: If the oil is dirty or old, change the oil and replace the oil filter to ensure proper flow.\n",
      "     - **Inspect Engine Bearings**: If low oil pressure persists, inspect the engine bearings for wear and replace if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Tire Pressure**\n",
      "   - **Diagnosis**: Low tire pressure can affect fuel efficiency and handling.\n",
      "   - **Maintenance Procedures**:\n",
      "     - **Check and Inflate Tires**: Measure the tire pressure and inflate to the manufacturerâ€™s recommended levels.\n",
      "     - **Inspect for Leaks**: Check for punctures or leaks that may be causing low pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Strange Noises When Braking**\n",
      "   - **Diagnosis**: This could indicate worn brake pads, warped rotors, or issues with the brake calipers.\n",
      "   - **Maintenance Procedures**:\n",
      "     - **Inspect Brake Pads and Rotors**: Check for wear on brake pads and inspect rotors for warping or damage. Replace as necessary.\n",
      "     - **Check Brake Calipers**: Ensure calipers are functioning properly and not sticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Poor Fuel Efficiency**\n",
      "   - **Diagnosis**: Poor fuel efficiency can be caused by a variety of factors including engine performance issues, tire pressure, and more.\n",
      "   - **Maintenance Procedures**:\n",
      "     - **Perform a Tune-Up**: Check spark plugs, air filters, and fuel filters. Replace as necessary to improve engine performance.\n",
      "     - **Check for Engine Codes**: Use an OBD-II scanner to check for any additional trouble codes that may indicate performance issues.\n",
      "     - **Inspect Fuel System**: Ensure the fuel injectors are clean and functioning properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
